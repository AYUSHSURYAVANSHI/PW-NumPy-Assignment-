    "# Line Plot: It represents data as points connected by straight lines. It is commonly used to visualize trends or relationships between two variables.\n",

    "# Bar Plot: It uses rectangular bars to compare categories or groups of data. It is useful for displaying and comparing discrete or categorical data.\n",
